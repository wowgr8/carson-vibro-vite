      "Brainwave entrainment is a method used to stimulate the brain into entering a specific state by using pulsing sounds, lights, or electromagnetic fields. Different conscious states are associated with distinct dominant brainwave frequencies. At Vibeâ€™n Thrive, we primarily focus on the theta and alpha brainwave states. Our goal is to guide your tired brain out of the monotonous beta state and into a more relaxed, rejuvenating state where true restoration can occur.",
